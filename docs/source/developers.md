We are still exploring the different approaches to find the ideal way to integrate this feature into the UI. For now, the only thing allowed in this feature is to add a section of code and not to modify the ones that are already present into the python class. 
To manually modify the file containing the current shader, it can be duplicated or opened by clicking on the "..." button and then "Duplicate" or "Open" in the "Custom shader" section :

or on the "Open File" button in the "Modify or Create Custom Shader" section :

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ETS-vis-interactive/SlicerPRISMRendering/master/docs/source/images/tutorials/limitations/editShader2.png" width ="60%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>
